## Credits

This project was originally forked from [code4craft/labpages](https://github.com/code4craft/labpages), all credits for
the original concept go to him.

also, please be kind and do not hesitate to make feedback if something goes wrong. This is my very first Ruby project
and I'm still not very familiar with this language. I did this only to play a bit with Ruby and discover this so
popular and fashion language.
